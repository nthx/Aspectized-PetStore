# Aspectized PetStore

So after great #wroclove.rb conference I've finally decided to roll 
my own design and implementation of Java Pet Store app


It's a well specified app with known functional requirements. 
It's quite real world scenario app. 
Its implementation can be compared to other platforms. 
So it's a good showcase for what I'm going to present.

##Will Include (not limited to)..

    * aop
    * domain usecases
    * facade
    * roles
    * coffeescript mixins
    * rails 
    * rails ActiveRecord .. not
    * ... ? who knows..
